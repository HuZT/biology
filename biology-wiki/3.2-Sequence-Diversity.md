##Sequence diversity

We have established the conception to compare sequence diversity to study biology diversity.

###How to compare sequence diversity

We can use software like **[BLAST](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)**(fast bust not very accurate, [detailed introduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST)) to compare different proteins/DNA. BLAST compare your sequence sample with its *DNA sequence database*. 

#### Compare 2 sequences

If we compare 2 sequences using BLAST, BLAST will calculate the sequence identity using [similarity matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_matrix) and gives you the results. (这里有一个使用BLAST进行序列分析的[例子](http://www.doc88.com/p-4741605525612.html)).

#### Multiple Sequence Alignment

If we compare many sequences, BLAST will search in its database and return you **Multiple Sequence Alignment**. According to this, you can draw the **protein sequence family tree**. (在上一个[例子](http://www.doc88.com/p-4741605525612.html)的后面部分有多重序列对比和画树图的演示)

##### Protein Family Tree

Here is an example of protein family tree:

This is Evolutionary analysis of the tree with radial view (for professional viewer):

Legends:

- Red-dotted sign means boostrap value more than 75.00 or 75%
- any number (in red) located near branching tree indicated boostrap value of the branching tree
- Green Line: The species belongs to Plants group
- Brown Line: Amoeba group
- Purple Line: Parasite type
- Pink Line : The species belongs to Insects Group
- Light Green Line: Worms Group
- Dark Blue Line: Invertebrate
- Red Line: Vertebrate

Why this tree looks like this? 

    Is the distance between 2 species represents the evolution trajectory? 

The tree is drawn under one assumption:

> *Molecule Clock* Assumption:  assume the evolution rate of protein/sequence is constant  

It sometimes causes problems. And another problem is:

    Can protein family tree represents the real evolution that happened in Earth?

##### Phylogenetic trees

Maybe not. But we can use Multiple Sequence Alignment to draw [phylogenetic trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) instead.

>A *phylogenetic tree* or *evolutionary tree* is a branching diagram or "tree" showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entities—their phylogeny—based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic characteristics. The taxa joined together in the tree are implied to have descended from a common ancestor.

Here is an example of Phylogenetic trees:

This picture is a speculatively rooted tree for rRNA genes, showing major branches Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucaryota.
