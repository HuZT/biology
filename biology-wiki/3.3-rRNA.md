## Which protein to choose?

In order to draw the *phylogenetic tree*, which protein should we choose to compare or should we compare all the proteins in speices?

First, compare all proteins are unrealistic. 

For example, humans have myosin(血红蛋白) in muscle, while plants don't have muscle :( Bacterial even have much less proteins than humans(还记得6倍protein么). 

    Now compare what? 

### Reproduction proteins

Luckily, all living species can reproduce, even for bacterial.

So we can compare their proteins that are involved in *reproduction*. That is to say, all living species have these proteins. Here we list some of these proteins that involves in reproduction:

- DNA polymerase([DNA聚合酶](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase))
- rRNA([核糖体RNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA)) & ribosomel protein(in ribosomel, 核糖体)
- ATP synthase([ATP合酶](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase))

Let's consider how DNA polymerase works. Look at the picture below,
